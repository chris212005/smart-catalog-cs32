# SmartCatalog – CS32 Project 3

This project is a simplified AI-powered product catalog system developed in C++ as part of UCLA's CS32 course (Data Structures and Algorithms). It demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts including polymorphism, abstract base classes, dynamic memory management, and virtual functions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Abstract base class (`Product`) with pure virtual methods
- ✅ Derived classes: `Clothing`, `Book`, and `Electronics`
- ✅ Substring-based keyword matching using `std::string::find()`
- ✅ Custom `printInfo()` function with formatted output
- ✅ Virtual destructors and memory-safe design
- ✅ All products dynamically allocated via `new` and cleaned with `delete`
- ✅ Output format fully aligned with autograder expectations

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Pure virtual functions
- Virtual destructors
- Base-class pointer usage
- Substring search logic
- Manual dynamic memory management (no STL)
